### Instructions

Build Out a Simple Sinatra application that displays the current time. 

1. Create a route called "/current_time" in the `app.rb` file. 
2. In the action, created an instance variable called `@readable_time` that takes the current time and converts it to a human readable format. Check out the documentation on Ruby's Time object and the strftime method [here](http://apidock.com/ruby/Time/strftime).
3. Make a new file, `current_time.erb`, that's rendered in the "/current_time" route. It should display something like "The current time is: 3:26PM"
